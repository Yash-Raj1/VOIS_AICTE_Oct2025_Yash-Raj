🧰 Tools & Libraries

The project is implemented in Python 3.x using the following libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation
numpy – Numerical computations
matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation
(Optional) plotly – Interactive charts

🧭 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Yash-Raj1/VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_Yash-Raj.git
cd VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_Yash-Raj

2. Install Dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the project file:

jupyter notebook VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_AirBNB_Yash_Raj.ipynb

📊 Methodology
Data Loading – Import Airbnb dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Summary statistics, feature distributions, correlations.
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling.
Feature Engineering – Creating additional features for better predictions.
Modeling – Applying machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification).
Evaluation – Using metrics such as accuracy, MAE, RMSE, or confusion matrix.
Visualization – Clear charts for trends, comparisons, and insights.
Insights – Final observations and recommendations.

📸 Visualizations
The Data Visualization.pdf file contains additional charts that highlight:

Distribution of numerical variables
Correlation heatmaps
Price trends based on features
Categorical breakdowns

📝 Results & Insights
Identified key factors affecting Airbnb pricing.
Built machine learning models for predictive analysis.
Derived business-level insights from the dataset.

📌 Future Improvements
Implement hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
Add interactive dashboards (Streamlit / Plotly Dash).
Extend the analysis with geospatial visualization.
Automate data pipeline for real-world Airbnb data.
